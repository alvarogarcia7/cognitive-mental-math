When the user is able to answer questions easily, increase the difficulty level of the questions presented.

This can be done by implementing a system that tracks the user's performance and adjusts the question difficulty accordingly. If the user answers a certain number of questions correctly in a row based on the history in the database, increase the difficulty level of the next set of questions.

Keep in mind to monitor the user's performance continuously, and if they start struggling with the higher difficulty questions, consider lowering the difficulty level again to maintain engagement and learning effectiveness.
